        <h1>Why I Love the Gym</h1>
        <p>The gym is more than just a place to work out; it’s where I push myself beyond my limits. Lifting weights and training hard isn’t just about physical strength—it’s about resilience, discipline, and self-improvement. Every rep, every drop of sweat, is a step closer to my goals. In a world that can feel overwhelming, the gym is my sanctuary. It’s where I take control and prove to myself what I’m capable of.</p>
