        <h1>Why I Love Cats</h1>
        <p>Cats embody a quiet confidence that I admire. They are independent yet affectionate, choosing their moments of connection with care. Spending time with cats reminds me that strength doesn’t always mean constant movement—sometimes, it means knowing when to rest. Their presence is a comforting balance to my structured, high-energy lifestyle. In many ways, I see myself in them: independent but deeply loyal to what I love.</p>
