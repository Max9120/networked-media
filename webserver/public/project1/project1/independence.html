        <h1>Gym & Cats: My Independence</h1>
        <p>Now you might be thinking "where the heck are you going with this?" It all comes to one thing--independence. The gym teaches me discipline and perseverance, while cats remind me to embrace solitude and self-sufficiency. Both have shaped the way I navigate life, balancing strength with gentleness. They remind me that independence isn’t about isolation—it’s about being strong enough to stand alone while knowing when to seek connection. These aspects of my life define how I grow as a person.</p>
